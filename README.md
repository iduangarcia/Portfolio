# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Cyclistic Data [Uploading Cyclist.ipynbâ€¦]()


Overview:

In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Cyclistic's bike-sharing data from 2023 using Python. The aim was to derive actionable insights to inform marketing strategies aimed at increasing member subscriptions on weekdays.

Key Tasks and Achievements:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered raw data from Cyclistic's database and performed necessary preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and formatting data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed ridership patterns: 

Investigated the distribution of rides over weekdays and weekends.

Member vs. Casual Riders: Explored the proportion of member vs. casual riders and their usage behavior.

Peak Usage Times: Identified peak hours and days of bike usage to target marketing efforts effectively.

Trip Duration Analysis: Examined the distribution of trip durations and identified potential areas for service improvement.

Geographic Analysis: Mapped out popular biking routes and stations to understand user preferences geographically.


Insights Generation:

Identified weekdays with low member subscription rates and compared them to high-subscription days.
Investigated factors contributing to the disparity, such as promotional offers, weather conditions, or user demographics.
Proposed targeted marketing strategies to increase member subscriptions on weekdays, such as offering weekday-specific discounts, launching promotional campaigns, or enhancing user experience during those days.

Visualization and Reporting:

Created informative visualizations using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate key findings effectively.
Prepared a comprehensive report summarizing the EDA findings, insights generated, and recommendations for action.

Key Skills Utilized:

Data Collection and Cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Python Programming (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Statistical Analysis

Impact:

The insights derived from this EDA can guide Cyclistic in formulating targeted marketing strategies to increase member subscriptions on weekdays, thereby enhancing overall business performance and revenue.

This project exemplifies my proficiency in data analysis and my ability to derive actionable insights from raw data to drive business decision-making effectively.

# Supply Reservations Report - March 2024


This project involved generating a comprehensive report on supply reservations for the month of March 2024. Data was extracted from SAP ECC and imported into a CSV file in Google Sheets. Subsequently, various data transformations, cleaning processes, and analysis were conducted, leading to the creation of pivot tables to filter and organize the data. Finally, a dashboard was developed using Google Looker Studio to present the insights to the relevant stakeholders, including your boss.

Key Tasks and Achievements:

Data Extraction and Import:

Extracted supply reservation data from SAP ECC for March 2024.
Imported the raw data into a CSV file in Google Sheets for further analysis.
Data Transformation and Cleaning:

Conducted necessary transformations and cleaning processes to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
Addressed issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and formatting errors.
Pivot Tables Creation:

Utilized pivot tables in Google Sheets to organize and summarize the supply reservation data effectively.
Implemented filters to segment the data based on relevant parameters such as product category, supplier, and reservation status.
Analysis and Insights Generation:

Analyzed supply reservation trends for March 2024, including volume, distribution across product categories, and supplier performance.
Identified any anomalies or patterns that required further investigation.
Derived actionable insights to optimize supply chain operations, improve inventory management, and enhance decision-making.
Dashboard Development:

Utilized Google Looker Studio to design an intuitive and visually appealing dashboard.
Incorporated key metrics, charts, and graphs to present the findings in a clear and concise manner.
Ensured interactivity and drill-down capabilities to enable stakeholders to explore the data dynamically.
Presentation to Stakeholders:

Presented the supply reservations report and dashboard to your boss and other relevant stakeholders.
Clearly communicated the insights, trends, and recommendations derived from the analysis.
Addressed any questions or concerns raised by the audience and provided additional context as needed.

Key Skills Utilized:

Data Extraction and Import
Data Transformation and Cleaning
Pivot Table Analysis
Data Visualization
Dashboard Development (Google Looker Studio)
Stakeholder Communication and Presentation

Impact:
The supply reservations report and dashboard provide valuable insights into supply chain performance for March 2024, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning. By leveraging data-driven insights, your organization can optimize inventory management, streamline procurement processes, and ultimately drive operational efficiency and cost savings.

This project demonstrates your proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and communication, as well as your ability to leverage technology tools to drive business outcomes effectively.
